        Paul Gauguin was a French Post-Impressionist
        artist. Unappreciated until after his death,
        Gauguin is now recognized for his experimental
        use of color and Synthetist style that were
        distinct from Impressionism. Toward the end
        of his life, he spent ten years in French
        Polynesia. The paintings from this time
        depict people or landscapes from that region.
      
        His work was influential on the French
        avant-garde and many modern artists, such
        as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, and he
        is well known for his relationship with
        Vincent and Theo van Gogh. Gauguin's art
        became popular after his death, partially
        from the efforts of dealer Ambroise Vollard,
        who organized exhibitions of his work late in
        his career and assisted in organizing two
        important posthumous exhibitions in Paris.
